## barbac: an R package for barocde data analysis

**barbac** is a versatile R package tailor-made for researchers and bioinformaticians working with barcoded sequences. Whether you're delving into the vast realm of genomic data or investigating the temporal dynamics of molecular barcodes, `barbac` has got you covered.

### Key Features:

1. **Barcode Extraction**: Efficiently and accurately extract barcode sequences from your genomic datasets.

2. **Clustering of Barcodes**: Group similar barcode sequences with the in-built clustering algorithm, providing meaningful insights into sequence families or operational taxonomic units (OTUs).

3. **Time Series Trajectories**: Dive deep into the temporal dynamics of barcoded sequences. `barbac` not only calculates but also visually represents the trajectory of each barcode over time, making it easier to discern patterns, trends, and anomalies.

### Applications:

- **Molecular Tracking**: Monitor the abundance and variations of specific molecular barcodes over different time points.
- **Biodiversity Analysis**: Understand the diversity and prevalence of barcode sequences in different samples.
- **Evolutionary Dynamics**: Track and visualize the emergence, dominance, and decline of barcoded sequences across time.

### Get Started:

To install `barbac` and embark on your barcode analysis journey:
```R
install.packages("barbac")
```
